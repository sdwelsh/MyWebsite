              I have a keen interest in pursuing a career combining business
              with IT management and have begun that journey at NC State
              concentrating in Business IT with a minor in Computer Science.
              Upon completion of my degree, I will have extensive knowledge of
              Java, C, SAS, MySQL, Excel data analysis, and Access as well as IT
              System and Database Management.
              <br />
              <br />
              As of the end of my sophomore year, I have completed introductory
              and intermediate Java programming classes in which I designed and
              created an enrollment system software and rental management
              software, among other projects. From my business Information
              Systems class, I learned how to create solutions in Excel to
              analyze data to solve specific business problems related to
              production amounts, supply chain issues, and forecasting.
              <br />
              <br />
              In addition to my course load, I have recently developed a
              financial software program called Open Finance. The goal of the
              application is to securely track all of the usersâ€™ financial
              investments, assets, and liabilities from a business/accounting
              perspective. The program was written to give the users a holistic
              overview of their financial state that is updated in real time
              without a need for their bank login credentials. The program was
              written in Java and JavaFX, with 10,000 lines of code in 44 files.
              My goal in creating this software is to help people understand the
              issues surrounding finance, including wealth generation, asset
              diversification, and the seriousness of long-term debt, with an
              extremely user-friendly interface.
              <br />
              <br />
              During my sophomore year, I was also very active in CMS Consulting
              at NC State. In the spring semester, I served as an Account
              Manager for CMS and worked with a Raleigh based start-up, Flux
              Hybrids, on marketing research and analysis for its business.
              During the course of the semester as an Account Manager, I led a
              six-person marketing team and facilitated client communication
              with Flux Hybrids. My team provided the client with SWOT analysis,
              competitor analysis, and marketing channel research, brochure
              templates, and recommendations on ad messaging, and client
              engagement.
              <br />
              <br />
              In the fall semester of my sophmore year, I worked as a Consultant
              on the NC State Day of Giving team. This allowed me to gain
              experience collecting and analyzing marketing data through
              services such as Qualtrics. In addition, while working on the NC
              State Day of Giving team last semester, I presented our findings
              to the NC State client team. That experience helped me hone my
              presentation skills in a professional setting.
